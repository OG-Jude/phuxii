     <br>
     Phûxii, your name dances on my lips,     <br>
     Like the gentle breeze through willow tips,     <br>
     In the vast ocean of faces, you shone bright,     <br>
     A radiant star in my darkest night.
     
     <br>     <br>     <br>
     The first semester's whispers carried our tales,     <br>
     Binding our hearts with invisible trails,     <br>
     But now the days pass, and I yearn for your touch,     <br>
     Missing you dearly, missing you so much.
     
     <br>     <br>     <br>
     As seasons change, our paths intertwine,     <br>
     Destiny's design, a love so divine,     <br>
     Through Tiinie Louw halls and blooming vineyards and the park,     <br>
     Our love grows stronger, defying all regards.
     
     <br>     <br>     <br>
     Phûxii, my love, distance cannot sever,     <br>
     For in my heart, you'll reside forever,     <br>
     Until the second semester arrives anew,     <br>
     Know that my love for you remains true.
     <br>     <br>     <br>
     Phûxii, my love, hear my soul's plea,<br>
     Across the distance, know you are the key,     <br>
     To happiness and joy, my heart's delight,
     Until we meet again, my love takes flight.
     
     <br>     <br>
     <strong>Until we reunite, my heart will persist,     <br>
     Longing for the day when our souls coexist.</strong>
          <br>     <br>

     <strong>Sir OG Jude <i> his gentleness:</i></strong>
 <br> <br>
     He is a romantic poet who specialises in loving Phûxii so hard <br> that he almost sold his favourite cat named <strong>Mr Whiskers</strong> to buy himself a ticket to Stellenbosch <br> not to see Phûxii but just to reduce the distance between <br> their hearts to increase the force of attraction as <br> proven by <strong>Sir Isaac Newton </strong>. <br> <br><strong>
